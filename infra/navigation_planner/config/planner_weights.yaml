# Planner Weights Configuration
# Weight values for different cost components in path planning

# Data closed loop parameters
# Automatically updated after each data collection mission
# Based on spatial distribution statistics of collected data
sparse_threshold: 0.2     # Areas with density below this value are considered sparse
exploration_bonus: 0.5    # Cost reduction for visiting sparse areas (encourages exploration)
redundancy_penalty: 0.4   # Additional cost for high-density areas (discourages redundancy)
grid_resolution: 1.0      # Grid resolution for density calculations (meters)
